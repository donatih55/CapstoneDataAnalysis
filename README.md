This is part of my senior project at Upper Iowa University from back in 2016. The data used for this project was confidential and fed directly from the school's ERP, which uses a MS SQL Server. When I moved it to my website that runs with MySQL, I generarted some fake data and changed the PHP calls accoridngly. 

The HeatMap no longer works as Google now requires an API token for it, but everything else should. 

I belive I need to make a few more adjustments to it, but the you'll get the overall.
